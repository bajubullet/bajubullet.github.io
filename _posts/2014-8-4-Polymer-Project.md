For developers it's really hard to design interfaces thankfully there are many easier alternatives these days like [twitter bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) etc. But the [polymer project](http://www.polymer-project.org) from google is best of them all. Its mobile ready with really smooth android L like transitions and is very easy to learn.


Polymer allows you to create new HTML components which can be used in the same way you use standard HTML elements like div, p etc. Creating these components is really easy and thanks to awesome documentation and videos from Google you can create a website that looks great on every screen in a matter of hours. It gives you basic elements like toolbar, sidebar etc that are used in almost every site in a single tag.


The functionality is not limited to UI either. You can also do JS in components which you can pass to your designers. Things like AJAX etc are nicely handled in some of the core components provided by polymer. Google has also created components for some of its core apps like map etc which make it easy to integrate those services in your website. They also serve as a nice template for you to port your apps to polymer.


If you want to play around with polymer the [online designer](http://www.polymer-project.org/tools/designer/) is a good starting point. It gives you workspace where you can drag-n-drop components. You can also see the code behind it with click of a button.
