title: New Blog!
---

I always wanted to write blogs and tried out many blogging platfoms but it was too much hastle to remember the credebtials maintain the blog so everytime I could not sustain it.
Today I read this [post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) about setting up a blog on Github in Smashing Magazine and as I use my github account regularly I hope to sustain this blog. This blog is mostly for remembering the stuff I have done, the problems faced and their solutions.
