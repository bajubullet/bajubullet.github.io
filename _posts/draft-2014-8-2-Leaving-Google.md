title: Leaving Google!
---

Yesterday I left a Vendor position at Google. My time here though short was really fulfilling. I met lots of like-minded people and
learnt many new things. This post is what I was supposed to say at my farewell but couldn't, don't know why?


Initailly when I interviewed for the position here I was not properly aware that this is a vendor position and even if I knew I
didn't understand the term vendor them. I was quite confident at that time which now I think should not be the case because I 
didn't knew or even heard about many things but still the first two interview with Arafat and Upadhyay Ji went smooth. The third
interview against Rafi was different during the initial discussion I found out that he was from my college so I thought this 
should be easy which was definitly not the case. He grilled me with few riddles and I didn't correctly answered even one. But
still some how I made it.

I came to Delhi with lot of excitement in my mind. Joining was awesome I was bombarded with a lot of new terms LDAP, OTP, 
TECHSTOP etc. coming from a small company I had no idea what they meant. Then I got confused by the team hierarchy didn't know
whether I should say gTech, DevShop or Internal Tools if someone asks me about my team.


People Descriptions:

Gautam

Me and Gautam joined on the same day. He was the most sincere of my friends here and usually a tiny bit better at games like 
foosball and TT etc because of experience from previous company :). He is very philosophical and thiest(usually defends the 
existance of god). He likes chick ficks and Vampire Diaries(kinda chick flick). Not very out going and his shayaris and songs
annoy me.


Deepali
